## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early, it contains 75% skin cancer deaths
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)
All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- A CNN model with no drop out helped us achieve 57 percent accuracy
- A CNN model with augmentation and dropout further reduced the accuracy percentage to 47
- A CNN model with data augmentation strategy  and class imbalance rectification by adding 500 samples to each class Helped us achieve 86 percent accuracy
